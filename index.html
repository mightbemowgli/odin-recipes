      <h3>Steak au Poivre</h3>
      <p>Steak au poivre sound as if it would be difficult, but it is actually quite simple 
         to prepare, and makes an easy and elegant meal. Essentially it is a sauteed steak, 
         with a quick pan sauce. This version made with black peppercorns tastes bright but 
         not overpoweringly peppery or boozy.</p>

      <h3>French Onion Soup</h3>
      <p>In 1954, what was then called the Food News Department of The New York Times released 
         a pamphlet simply called “Soups,” which had 20 recipes for soups “thick and thin, hot 
         and cold,” including those for minestrone, shrimp bisque and this French onion soup.</p>

      <h3>Ratatouille</h3>
      <p>In this classic Provençal dish, summer vegetables, like eggplant, onions, peppers, tomatoes 
         and zucchini, are covered in olive oil and roasted separately, then all together, until 
         they become a soft, harmonious stew. Ratatouille takes some time to make, so plan ahead.</p>
